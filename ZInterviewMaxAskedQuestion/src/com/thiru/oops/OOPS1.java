 1) Why OOPs is so popular?
 ========================


short:(
===>writing complex piece code is easily,
===>users to handle and maintain them easily as well,
===>	piller of oops)




OOPs, programming paradigm is considered as a better style of programming.
Not only it helps in writing a complex piece of code easily, 
but it also allows users to handle and maintain them easily as well. Not only that,
the main pillar of OOPs - Data Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism,
makes it easy for programmers to solve complex scenarios.
As a result of these, OOPs is so popular.
 
 6) What are the advantages and disadvantages of OOP?
 ===================================================

Advantages of OOP
================ 
 BP,ALR , DC CMPX=>SMLR CHUNKS,REACH GOALS, MIN COMPLEXITY,ED EXT CODE

    It follows a bottom-up approach.//
    It allows us the reusability of code.//
    Decompose a complex problem into smaller chunks.//
    Programmer are able to reach their goals faster.//
    Minimizes the complexity.//
    Easy redesign and extension of code that does not affect the other functionality.//

Disadvantages of OOP
==================== PPLANNIN,DESIGHN TRICKY, PROG WELL SKILLED

    Proper "planning is required"
    Program "design is tricky."
    Programmer "should be well skilled."
  


//Object-oriented Programming(oops)
//=========================================
//It follows a bottom-up approach.//
//It provides data hiding.//
//It is used to solve complex problems.//
//It allows reusability of code that reduces redundancy of code.//
//It is based on objects rather than functions and procedures.//
//It provides more security as it has a data hiding feature.
//More abstraction more flexibility.
//It focuses on data.



//Structural Programming
//=================================
//It follows a top-down approach.
//Data hiding is not allowed.
//It is used to solve "moderate problems."
//Reusability of code is not allowed.
//It provides a logical structure to a program in which the program is divided into functions.
//It provides less security as it does not support the data hiding feature.
//Less abstraction less flexibility.
//It focuses on the process or logical structure.

 Class																				Object(r)
 =========																			======
It is a logical entity.																It is a real-world entity.												
It is conceptual.																	It is real.
It binds data/variables and methods together into a single unit.[D,V,M]				It is just like a variable of a class.
It does not occupy space in the memory.												It occupies space in the memory.
It is a "data type" that represents the blueprint of an object.						It is an instance of the class.
It is declared once.																Multiple objects can be declared as and when required.
It uses the keyword class when declared.											It uses the "new keyword" to create an object.	
A class can exist without any object.											    Objects cannot exist without a class.

15) What are the rules for creating a constructor?(Static,abstract,overriden,final)soaf
===================================================
    It cannot have a "return type".
    It must have the same name as the Class name.
    
    It cannot be marked as static.
    It cannot be marked as abstract.
    It cannot be overridden.
    It cannot be final.
